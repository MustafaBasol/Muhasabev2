# Organization Members Feature - Quick Start Guide

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The Organization Members UI & API has been successfully implemented with the following features:

### 🔧 Components Created

1. **`OrganizationMembersPage.tsx`** - Main page at `/settings/organization/members`
   - Lists all organization members with role badges
   - Shows pending invitations
   - Integrates invite form and member management

2. **`MemberList.tsx`** - Member management component
   - Displays members in a table format with avatars
   - Role badges (OWNER/ADMIN/MEMBER) with appropriate icons and colors
   - Role management dropdown for authorized users
   - Remove member functionality (with restrictions)
   - Responsive design with hover effects

3. **`InviteForm.tsx`** - Member invitation component
   - Email input with validation
   - Role selection (based on current user permissions)
   - Plan limit enforcement
   - Toggle form visibility

4. **`JoinOrganizationPage.tsx`** - Invitation acceptance page
   - Token validation and invite display
   - Organization details preview
   - Accept/decline functionality
   - Comprehensive error handling (expired, invalid, already member)

### 🌍 Internationalization

Added complete Turkish translations under `org.members.*`:
- Member management UI text
- Role names and descriptions
- Invitation system messages
- Status messages and errors
- Join flow text

### 🔗 API Integration

**`organizations.ts`** API client with all endpoints:
- Organization CRUD operations
- Member management (list, update role, remove)
- Invitation system (send, accept, validate, cancel, resend)
- Comprehensive error handling and TypeScript types

### 🚦 Routing System

Hash-based routing added to `App.tsx`:
- `#settings/organization/members` - Organization members page
- `#join?token=ABC123` - Join organization page
- Automatic token extraction and validation

### 🔐 Security & Permissions

**Role-based Access Control:**
- **OWNER**: Full control (invite, remove, change roles, delete organization)
- **ADMIN**: Can invite and manage members (except OWNER)
- **MEMBER**: View-only access

**Permission Checks:**
- Only OWNER/ADMIN can send invitations

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","role":"MEMBER"}' \
